I have a job. The reason you are getting this application is not because I am in need of work but because I am yearning for a greater challenge and a more ambitious goal. Knewton's mission, as well as your adaptive learning approach, is completely aligned with not just my ideas for the education industry but also my professional experience.

I am a UX designer currently working at a school with several years of experience under my belt. My work with a very lean team has led me to a profound understanding of both the design and development process and I am confident that this unique, well-rounded skillset will let me make a major contribution at Knewton.

Please allow me the opportunity to come in and speak with you in person. My passion for all facets of experience design and my ability to quickly learn will ensure that you will not be disappointed.
