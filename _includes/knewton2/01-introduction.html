        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being entirely self taught by countless online lectures, MOOCs, tutorials, articles, podcasts, e-books and more, I have personally experienced how empowering technology is to the education industry.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have gone on to become a producer, as well as a result, of this new era of learning. Working at a music school with a lean team allowed me to think about and create a wide array of digital experiences for both physical and online classrooms, teachers and staff.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can think about an idea from many angles and every level of the digital design process. From whiteboarding the overall product experience to debugging a JavaScript error, I would bring value to my team at Knewton in a powerful way; Acting as a glue between designers, developers, product managers and turning our work into results and delight for Knewtonâ€™s users.</p>
