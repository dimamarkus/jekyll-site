<h1>Sapayol</h1>

Clarify the complex choices designers have to make and explain their thinking behind UX and visual decisions.

- State Both Broad And Concrete Goals
- Define your broad project goal early in the case study, with a focus on larger issues like community, the environment or empowerment.
- Attach your concrete goal to the deliverables of the project or the technical problems you hope to solve.

- Illustrate your design process to the reader with simple, easy-to-understand steps, ones that they can duplicate in their own projects.
- Show photographs of your team working collaboratively, in situations that illustrate your design process.
- If possible, list your collaborators and the roles they played. This moves the case study towards an exploration of people and process, beyond simply a description of design deliverables.


- Show your research with photos, charts or a list of findings, even if it is not packaged neatly.
- For code, tools such as GitHubâ€™s Gist or CodePen can illustrate your research to the technically savvy.
- Show relationships between data, research and design artifact, either in writing or by associating them visually for readers to compare.
